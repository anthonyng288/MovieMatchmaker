This is version 2.0 of my former Cloud Computing Assignment "Streaming Availability". A whole new redesign and some new features

  - DB: MongoDB 
  - Hosting: Vercel

Notes
- I want to try adding tests to this 
- I would also like to try adding a CI/CD Pipeline to this, everytime I build it will test the build (not sure what Im gonna test tho)
